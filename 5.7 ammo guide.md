## Ruger-57 offers comparable performance at half the price

Introduced at SHOT Show 2020, the Ruger-57 democratized 5.7x28mm ownership with a street price of **$380-450** versus $900-1,100 for the FN. The Ruger features more conventional American-style controls, including a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety.

### Ruger-57 vs FN Five-seveN comparison

| Specification | Ruger-57 | FN Five-seveN |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **Barrel length** | 4.94" | 4.8" |
| **Overall length** | 8.65" | 8.2" |
| **Weight (empty)** | 24.5 oz | 21 oz |
| **Trigger pull** | 4.75 lbs | 4.4-7.87 lbs |
| **Safety location** | Frame-mounted 1911-style | Above trigger guard |
| **Magazine type** | Steel (proprietary) | Polymer (proprietary) |
| **Optics ready** | Yes (adapter plates) | MRD variant only |
| **MSRP** | $549 | $1,409-1,509 |

The Ruger's **0.14-inch longer barrel** produces approximately **50-100 fps higher velocities** with identical ammunition. Review testing shows the Ruger achieving **1.78-1.98 inch groups at 25 yards**, often outperforming the FN in mechanical accuracy. Key differences include the Ruger's blade-in-trigger safety, lack of magazine disconnect (will fire without magazine), and steel rather than polymer magazines.

## 5.7x28mm cartridge delivers rifle-like velocity from pistol platforms

### Cartridge dimensions

| Specification | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| **Case length** | 28.90mm (1.138") |
| **Overall length** | 40.50mm max (1.594") |
| **Bullet diameter** | 5.70mm (0.224") |
| **Base diameter** | 7.95mm (0.313") |
| **SAAMI max pressure** | 48,500 PSI |
| **CIP max pressure** | 50,037 PSI (345 MPa) |
| **Rim type** | Rebated rimless |
| **Primer** | Small rifle, Boxer |

The bottleneck design uses a rebated rim—smaller than the case body—which allows the high-pressure cartridge to headspace on the case shoulder while maintaining reliable feeding from double-stack magazines.

## Terminal ballistics reveal significant limitations versus 9mm

Extensive gel testing shows **most civilian 5.7x28mm loads fail the FBI's 12-inch minimum penetration standard** from pistol-length barrels. The cartridge relies on tumbling and fragmentation rather than controlled expansion.

### FBI protocol gel test results (10% ordnance gelatin, heavy clothing)

| Load | Penetration | Expansion | Notes |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| SS197SR (40gr V-MAX) | 12-15.25" | 0.343" max | Only FN load meeting FBI minimum |
| SS195LF (27gr) | 8-10" | None (tumbles) | Fails penetration standard |
| SS198LF (27gr) | 8.25-9" | Limited | Creates 3-4" temporary cavity |
| Speer Gold Dot (40gr) | 12-20" | 0.29-0.34" | **Best defensive choice** |
| Federal AE FMJ (40gr) | 32"+ | None | Full over-penetration |
| Elite T6B | 16-18" | Tip separates | Solid copper, exotic |

The **Speer Gold Dot** stands alone as the only commercially available 5.7x28mm load specifically designed for self-defense that consistently achieves adequate penetration with controlled expansion from pistol barrels.

### Comparative performance: 5.7x28mm vs 9mm

| Metric | 5.7x28mm | 9mm Parabellum |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Muzzle velocity | 1,650-2,200 fps | 1,000-1,400 fps |
| Muzzle energy | 220-340 ft-lbs | 350-450 ft-lbs |
| Typical penetration | 9-12" | 12-18" |
| Expansion diameter | 0.27-0.35" | 0.50-0.70" |
| Recoil | ~30% less | Baseline |
| Magazine capacity | 20+1 | 15-17+1 |

The 5.7x28mm compensates for its energy deficit with **velocity and capacity advantages**. Temporary wound cavities reach 1-4 inches diameter depending on load, with lightweight bullets dumping energy rapidly in the first 6-8 inches of penetration.

## Armor penetration requires restricted ammunition or rifle barrels

The SS190's armor-piercing capability is classified as **AP handgun ammunition under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(17)**, restricting civilian sales. Testing confirms:

- **SS197SR from Five-seveN pistol**: STOPPED by Level IIIA soft armor
- **SS190 from Five-seveN pistol**: Penetrates one panel, stops on backface
- **SS197SR from PS90 (16" barrel)**: PENETRATES both sides of IIIA
- **SS190 from P90 (10.4" barrel)**: Full penetration with continued gel travel

Civilian ammunition simply lacks the velocity from short pistol barrels to defeat body armor. The **2,000+ fps threshold** generally required for Level IIIA penetration is only achieved by restricted loads or from carbine-length barrels producing 2,300+ fps.

---

## Trajectory and effective range exceed typical handgun cartridges

The high velocity produces remarkably flat trajectory for a pistol cartridge:

| Distance | 5.7x28mm (40gr) | 9mm (124gr) |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 50 yards (zero) | 0" | 0" |
| 100 yards | -3.8" | -8"+ |
| 150 yards | -10" | -20"+ |

FN specifies **50 meters effective range** from the Five-seveN pistol, though skilled shooters report consistent hits on steel targets at 100 yards. The .22-caliber bullet's **ballistic coefficient of 0.20** (for 40gr V-MAX) outperforms typical 9mm loads.

---

## Key implementation parameters for FiveM weapon meta

**Recoil modeling**: Set at 30-40% of 9mm baseline values. The delayed blowback system combined with lighter projectile mass produces minimal muzzle rise, enabling significantly faster follow-up shots. Subjective feel comparable to .22 Magnum.

**Damage calculations**: Base damage should reflect the 240-290 ft-lb energy range—approximately 60-70% of 9mm energy but with higher penetration modifiers against unarmored targets. Implement velocity-dependent damage falloff given the rapid energy dump in first 6-8 inches.

**Capacity**: Standard 20+1 rounds, extended 30+1. This represents 25-40% capacity advantage over comparable 9mm platforms.

**Armor interaction**: Civilian loads (SS197SR equivalent) should be stopped by Level IIIA body armor. Only military/AP variants should penetrate soft armor, and only at close range with full velocity.

**Accuracy**: Above-average for pistol class. The 7-inch sight radius and low recoil combine for excellent precision at distance. Effective range 50-100 yards—double typical 9mm engagement distances.

**Sound/visual**: Distinctive sharp supersonic crack, moderate muzzle flash. Louder report than expected given low recoil. Subsonic loads (62gr) eliminate supersonic crack for suppressed configurations.

**Ammunition differentiation**: Consider implementing distinct behavior for V-MAX (fragmentation, reduced penetration), FMJ (over-penetration), Gold Dot (balanced expansion/penetration), and AP variants (armor defeat capability).
