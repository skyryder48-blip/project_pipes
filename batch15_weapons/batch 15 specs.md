# Batch 15 SMG specifications for FiveM weapon meta

Seven 9mm submachine gun and pistol-caliber carbine platforms form this batch, spanning premium military SMGs to budget civilian options. The **H&K MP5K's roller-delayed system delivers the smoothest recoil** of any platform, while the **SIG MPX's gas piston operation** provides superior suppressor compatibility. Barrel length drives the primary ballistic differences: a 4.5" SMG barrel yields only **9% more energy than a standard pistol**, while an 8" barrel delivers **29% more energy**—the sweet spot for damage scaling. For game balance, SMG advantages should emphasize accuracy and controllability over raw damage increases.

## Part 1: H&K MP5K delivers premium performance in compact form

The MP5K represents Heckler & Koch's ultra-compact variant of the legendary MP5, introduced in 1976 for VIP protection and close-quarters operations. Its **4.53-inch barrel** produces muzzle velocities of approximately **1,191-1,200 fps with 115gr ammunition** and **1,110-1,143 fps with 124gr loads**—roughly 40-100 fps faster than a standard 4-inch pistol barrel.

| Specification | MP5K Standard | MP5K-PDW |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Barrel length | 4.53" (115mm) | 5.51" (140mm) threaded |
| Overall length | 12.60" | 14.53" folded / ~23.7" extended |
| Weight (empty) | **4.4 lbs** | 6.49 lbs |
| Rate of fire | 900 RPM | 900 RPM |
| Sight radius | 10.24" | ~10.24" |
| Magazine options | 15, 30 rounds | 15, 30 rounds |

The roller-delayed blowback operating system makes the MP5 family exceptionally smooth. Two rollers on the bolt head lock into barrel extension recesses; before the bolt can retract, these rollers must be driven inward by curved locking shoulders, creating a mechanical disadvantage that **delays bolt opening until chamber pressure drops to safe levels**. This spreads the recoil impulse over a longer period, reducing felt recoil compared to direct blowback designs. The system also permits a lighter bolt while safely containing pressure, contributing to the characteristic "soft push" shooters describe.

The MP5K fires from a **closed bolt in all modes** (semi, burst, full-auto), improving first-shot accuracy compared to open-bolt SMGs. Three trigger group configurations exist: SEF (Safe-Semi-Full), the Navy trigger group with 2-round burst, and 3-round burst variants. Civilian SP5K-PDW models run **$2,700-3,000+** while transferable pre-ban machine guns command **$29,000+**. Military and law enforcement adoption spans over 40 nations including Germany's GSG 9, UK SAS, and numerous US agencies.

**Effective range** for the MP5K is **25-50 meters** in combat conditions, with the full-size MP5's 8.9-inch barrel extending this to 100-200 meters. Energy retention from the 4.5" barrel at 25 yards drops to approximately **364 ft-lbs** and **270 ft-lbs at 100 yards** with 124gr ammunition starting at ~1,200 fps.

## Part 2: SIG MPX brings gas piston innovation to 9mm

The SIG MPX represents a fundamental departure from traditional SMG design by using a **short-stroke gas piston system**—the same operating principle as rifle-caliber platforms like the MCX. SIG chose this approach specifically to optimize suppressor performance and reduce felt recoil below what blowback designs achieve.

| Configuration | Barrel | Overall Length | Weight | Folded Length |
|---------------|--------|----------------|--------|---------------|
| MPX Copperhead | 3.5" | ~17" | ~4.5 lbs | ~12" |
| MPX K | 4.5" | 22.25" | **5 lbs** | ~14.5" |
| MPX Standard | 8" | ~28" | 6.5-7.6 lbs | ~20" |
| MPX PCC | 16" | 35.2" | 6.6-7.6 lbs | N/A (fixed stock) |

The gas piston system works by tapping gas from a port near the chamber (positioned closer than rifle platforms due to 9mm's lower gas volume), driving a short-stroke pushrod that cycles the action. This creates several advantages: the bolt carrier can be **42% lighter than blowback equivalents** while still cycling reliably, felt recoil becomes a "smooth push" rather than the sharp impulse of blowback systems, and **gas doesn't cycle through the action** like direct impingement systems, making suppressed shooting cleaner.

The MPX fires from a **closed, rotating bolt**—extremely rare in SMG designs and providing rifle-like lockup strength. Dual recoil springs housed inside the receiver eliminate the need for a buffer tube, allowing the stock to fold and **the weapon to fire while folded**. Current production models include a **Timney single-stage flat trigger** as standard equipment.

**Ballistic performance** scales with barrel length: the 4.5" MPX K produces approximately **1,200-1,250 fps with 115gr** ammunition, the 8" standard barrel reaches **1,350-1,400 fps**, and the 16" carbine achieves **1,450-1,500 fps**—pushing some loads into .357 Magnum territory. The select-fire military version cycles at **850 RPM**, slightly slower than the MP5's 900 RPM but with noticeably softer recoil.

Magazine options include **20, 30, and 35-round proprietary polymer magazines** manufactured by Lancer—not compatible with Glock, Colt, or MP5 magazines. Civilian models retail for **$1,800-2,200** depending on configuration. The U.S. Army awarded SIG a **$13.4 million contract** in 2018 for MPX units with 4.5" and 8" barrels, while the MPX Copperhead competed (unsuccessfully) against the B&T APC9K for the Army's Sub Compact Weapon program.

## Part 3: CZ Scorpion EVO 3 offers budget-friendly performance

The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 delivers solid SMG capability at roughly one-third the cost of premium competitors. The civilian S1 pistol version features a **7.72-inch barrel** while the S1 carbine extends to **16.2 inches**. Despite the "Scorpion" name, the EVO 3 shares no mechanical relation to the Cold War-era vz. 61—it's an entirely modern design adopted by the Czech military and exported to over 30 countries.

| Specification | S1 Pistol | S1 Carbine | A1 (Military) |
|---------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Barrel length | 7.72" | 16.2" | 7.81" |
| Overall length | 16.35" / 26.1" | 34.75" | 18.1" / 26.1" |
| Weight | **~5.0 lbs** | ~6.2 lbs | 6.11 lbs |
| Rate of fire | Semi-auto | Semi-auto | **1,150 RPM** |
| MSRP | ~$850-1,000 | ~$1,050-1,200 | Military only |

The **1,150 RPM cyclic rate** on the military A1 variant is exceptionally high—nearly double the Uzi's 600 RPM despite similar bolt weights. This results from the shorter bolt throw distance in the EVO 3's compact action. The simple blowback operating system requires no gas system maintenance but produces more felt recoil than roller-delayed or gas-operated alternatives.

The factory trigger represents the platform's most criticized element, pulling at **9-10+ pounds** with a gritty, spongy feel. The HB Industries reduced weight spring kit (**$9**) drops this to 4.5-5.5 pounds and ranks among the most popular upgrades. The ambidextrous safety selector digs into the firing hand for many shooters, spawning a cottage industry of AK-style selector replacements.

From the 7.72" barrel, expect velocities of approximately **1,180 fps with 124gr Hydra-Shok** and **1,234 fps with 115gr Federal JHP**. The 16.2" carbine barrel pushes these to **1,243-1,250 fps** and **1,295-1,320 fps** respectively. Accuracy testing demonstrates sub-1-inch groups at 25 yards and **2.1-inch groups at 50 yards** with quality ammunition—competitive with platforms costing three times as much.

Magazine compatibility uses **20 and 30-round proprietary magazines** priced at **$14-20**—dramatically cheaper than MP5 ($89) or MPX ($79) magazines. The folding stock collapses to the right side, ambidextrous controls include paddle-style magazine releases on both sides of the trigger guard, and the non-reciprocating charging handle can be swapped between left and right positions.

## Part 4: Intratec TEC-9 earned its notorious reputation

The TEC-9's aggressive appearance belies its mechanical shortcomings—it became a cultural icon of 1990s violence despite being genuinely unreliable and inaccurate. Designed by Swedish engineer George Kellgren (who later founded Kel-Tec), the platform evolved through several variants to circumvent increasingly restrictive legislation.

| Variant | Production | Key Changes |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| KG-9 | 1981-1982 | Open-bolt, ~2,500 produced before ATF forced redesign |
| KG-99 | 1982-1985 | Closed-bolt, same basic design |
| TEC-9 | 1985-1994 | Renamed under Intratec, **250,000+ sold** |
| TEC-DC9 | 1990-1994 | "Designed for California" after state ban |
| AB-10 | 1995-2001 | "After Ban" variant without threaded barrel |

The original KG-9 used **open-bolt operation**—the bolt sits rearward until the trigger releases it forward to chamber and fire. The ATF determined this was too easily converted to full-auto and forced the 1982 redesign to closed-bolt operation. The **5-inch threaded barrel** (3 inches on Mini variants) produces muzzle velocities around **1,181 fps** per manufacturer specifications.

| Specification | TEC-9 Full Size | TEC-9 Mini |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| Barrel length | 5" (threaded) | 3" |
| Overall length | 12.5" | 9.5" |
| Weight | **3.1 lbs** | 2.7 lbs |
| Magazine options | 20, 32, 50+ rounds | Same |

The platform's **notorious inaccuracy** stems from multiple factors: shallow rifling that some owners describe as "might as well be smoothbore," heavy bolt movement disrupting sight picture during cycling, crude non-adjustable sights welded in place, and forward magazine placement creating severe balance issues. Effective accuracy extends only to **center-mass hits at approximately 10 yards**.

Build quality suffered from budget manufacturing—the polymer lower receiver can crack with hot loads or heavy-grain ammunition, and quality control reportedly declined further after Intratec's 1987 bankruptcy. The platform works better with FMJ ammunition; hollow points commonly cause stovepipes and failures to feed. Magazine capacities reached **72 rounds** with aftermarket drums, though reliability suffered accordingly.

Historical pricing ran **$150-350**, making it attractive to criminals. Current collector values range from **$263-305** for 80% condition specimens to **$893+** for pre-ban examples with original accessories. The 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban specifically named the TEC-9 among 19 prohibited firearms. Intratec dissolved in 2001 after the California Supreme Court ruled against liability for the 1993 101 California Street shooting.

## Part 5: Masterpiece Arms MPA30 fixes MAC-style design flaws

Masterpiece Arms built its reputation as "the company that fixed the MAC-10," and the MPA30 series represents that philosophy applied to 9mm. Where the TEC-9 used stamped steel and molded polymer prone to failure, MPA employs **CNC-machined aluminum receivers** with consistent tolerances and a lifetime warranty.

| Model | Barrel | Weight | Magazine Type | MSRP |
|-------|--------|--------|---------------|------|
| MPA30T (top-cocking) | 4.5-5.5" | **55 oz (3.44 lbs)** | Proprietary polymer | $540 |
| MPA30SST (side-cocking) | Threaded | Similar | STEN-pattern | $609 |
| MPA30DMG | Various | Similar | **Glock-compatible** | $750-799 |

The MPA30T includes a **30+1 capacity** with the included polymer magazine, adjustable front and rear sights (unlike TEC-9's crude fixed sights), threaded barrel (1/2 x 28), and stock interface for rifle stocks or SB15 braces. The side-cocking MPA30SST uses STEN-pattern magazines—originally chosen during the AWB era when surplus WWII magazines were cheap and abundant.

The Glock-compatible MPA30DMG accepts Glock 17 and 33-round magazines and offers **multi-caliber capability** with bolt/barrel changes (.40 S&W, .357 SIG) or grip changes (5.7x28mm). All models feature Cerakote finishes, quick-disconnect sling mounts, and Picatinny rail sections.

Build quality improvements over the TEC-9 include a **hammer-fired trigger** with disconnect (eliminating trigger slap), properly heat-treated components, and consistent feeding geometry. Ballistic performance from the 4.5-5.5" barrel matches standard expectations: **~1,150-1,200 fps with 115gr FMJ** and **~1,100-1,150 fps with 124gr loads**. The machined aluminum construction and improved manufacturing translate to practical accuracy the TEC-9 could never achieve.

## Part 6: AR-9 platforms leverage familiar controls and modularity

The AR-9 adapts the AR-15 platform to 9mm, originating from Colt's Model 635 SMG introduced in the early 1980s. Modern civilian versions share 80-90% parts compatibility with standard AR-15s while accepting either Colt-pattern or Glock-pattern pistol magazines. The fictional "RAM 9 DESERT" would likely follow typical AR-9 SBR/pistol specifications.

| Barrel Length | Config Type | Velocity (115gr) | Weight Range |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| 4-5" | Ultra-compact | ~1,150-1,166 fps | 4.5-5 lbs |
| 7-8" | Compact pistol/SBR | **~1,223-1,234 fps** | 5-5.5 lbs |
| 8.3-10.5" | Mid-length | ~1,238-1,253 fps | 5.5-6 lbs |
| 16" | Carbine | ~1,295-1,300 fps | 6.5-7 lbs |

Most AR-9s use **direct blowback operation**, requiring heavier bolts (15-16 oz vs 11.5 oz for 5.56) and buffers (5.5-8.5 oz vs 3-5.5 oz) to safely contain chamber pressure. This creates a "snappier" recoil impulse than gas-operated 5.56 AR-15s—counterintuitively, despite the smaller caliber. CMMG's **Radial Delayed Blowback** system uses chamfered bolt lugs that must rotate before unlocking, reducing reciprocating mass by 42% and producing noticeably softer recoil.

**Glock-pattern magazines** offer ubiquitous availability ($15-30), compatibility with Glock pistols, and capacities up to 33+ rounds, but single-column feeding can cause reliability issues and Last Round Bolt Hold Open (LRBHO) implementation varies. **Colt-pattern magazines** use more reliable double-feed geometry with consistent LRBHO but cost more ($20-38) and don't share compatibility with common sidearms.

| Manufacturer | Tier | Price Range | Notable Features |
|--------------|------|-------------|------------------|
| Palmetto State Armory | Budget | $500-675 | 4150 CMV barrel, lifetime warranty |
| Foxtrot Mike FM-9 | Mid | $550-700 | Patented LRBHO, removable BCG weight |
| Aero Precision EPC-9 | Mid | $800-1,100 | Forged receivers, integrated LRBHO |
| CMMG Banshee | Premium | **$1,271-1,549** | Radial Delayed, 11 Cerakote colors |

The AR platform provides accuracy advantages over traditional SMGs through longer sight radius, stable three-point shooting position, free-floated handguards, and compatibility with AR-pattern drop-in triggers. Expect **2-3" groups at 25 yards** and reliable torso hits at 100 yards.

---

## Part 7: Kel-Tec SUB-2000 maximizes portability and velocity

The SUB-2000's signature feature is its ability to **fold completely in half** to exactly 16.25" × 7"—fitting in backpacks, briefcases, or vehicle compartments. The barrel/forend assembly rotates 180° backward to fold over the action and buttstock, with the front sight clipping into a cutout in the stock. At **4.25 pounds unloaded**, it's the lightest platform in this batch.

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Barrel length | **16.25"** |
| Overall length (extended) | 30.5" |
| Folded dimensions | **16.25" × 7"** |
| Weight | **4.25 lbs** |
| Trigger pull | 9.5 lbs (heavy) |
| MSRP | **$578-621** |

The 16.25" barrel extracts maximum practical velocity from 9mm ammunition. BBTI testing shows **1,317 fps with Federal 115gr JHP** and **1,270 fps with 124gr Hydra-Shok**—the highest velocities of any platform in this batch. Hot loads like CorBon 90gr JHP +P reach **1,751 fps**, approaching .357 Magnum performance.

Magazine compatibility represents a major selling point—variants accept **Glock, Smith & Wesson M&P, Beretta 92, and SIG P226 magazines**, allowing ammunition and magazine sharing with paired sidearms. The "Multi-Mag" versions include interchangeable magazine catches for different platforms.

The straight blowback operation produces moderate-high felt recoil, and the **9.5-pound trigger pull** ranks among the heaviest in this batch (though M*CARBO spring kits reduce this below 5 pounds). The tube sight design with plastic rear aperture receives criticism for durability and requires pressing the cheek hard against the bolt tube for proper sight alignment. Gen 3 models add a rotating forend allowing optics to remain mounted while folding.

Reliability concerns center on the folding mechanism potentially loosening over time and front sight alignment shifting with repeated folding cycles. A 2017 barrel material issue on Gen 2 models was resolved by Kel-Tec. Overall, the platform trades some ergonomic refinement for maximum portability and velocity at a budget price point.

---

## Part 8: 9mm ballistics scale predictably with barrel length

Velocity increases follow a consistent pattern: gains of **~50 fps per inch** in pistol barrel ranges (3-5"), decreasing to **~25-35 fps per inch** in SMG ranges (5-8"), and minimal gains (**<10 fps per inch**) beyond 10-12 inches. Velocity typically **decreases after 17-18 inches** as barrel friction exceeds propellant energy.

| Barrel Length | 115gr Velocity | 124gr Velocity | 147gr Velocity |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 3" (pocket) | ~1,029 fps | ~988 fps | ~850 fps |
| 4" (standard pistol) | ~1,094 fps | ~1,061 fps | ~920 fps |
| 5" (full-size/TEC-9) | ~1,166 fps | ~1,115 fps | ~970 fps |
| 8" (standard SMG) | ~1,234 fps | ~1,180 fps | ~1,030 fps |
| 9" (MP5) | ~1,238 fps | ~1,212 fps | ~1,050 fps |
| 16" (carbine) | ~1,295 fps | ~1,243 fps | ~1,073 fps |

The **optimal efficiency point** falls at **7-8 inches**—where velocity-per-inch gains remain meaningful. Beyond 10-12 inches, most loads achieve maximum practical velocity with diminishing returns. The 16-17" range represents peak velocity before friction losses begin reducing performance.

**Muzzle energy scales with velocity squared**, creating more dramatic differences:

| Configuration | Velocity (124gr) | Muzzle Energy | % vs Pistol |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| 4" pistol | 1,100 fps | ~333 ft-lbs | Baseline |
| 4.5" short SMG | 1,150 fps | ~364 ft-lbs | +9% |
| 8" standard SMG | 1,250 fps | **~430 ft-lbs** | **+29%** |
| 16" carbine | 1,300 fps | **~466 ft-lbs** | **+40%** |

Hollow point expansion requires minimum velocities of **~1,000-1,050 fps** for reliable performance. Modern premium bullets (Federal HST, Speer Gold Dot) function reliably down to ~950 fps. However, **carbine velocities can cause over-expansion**—Gold Dot 124gr +P at 1,400 fps from 16" barrels exhibited uncontrolled deformation in Lucky Gunner testing, leading to under-penetration. The 147gr subsonic loads perform most consistently across all barrel lengths due to lower velocity variance.

At 100 yards, 9mm retains approximately **60% of muzzle velocity** and **40% of muzzle energy**. A 16" carbine starting at 1,300 fps drops to ~1,000 fps and ~276 ft-lbs at 100 yards—still adequate for expansion with modern bullets but representing significant degradation compared to rifle calibers.

## Part 9: Damage scaling should emphasize accuracy over raw damage

With a 9mm pistol baseline of **34 damage**, barrel length increases should provide modest damage scaling while SMG advantages concentrate on accuracy, controllability, and rate of fire.

| Weapon Type | Barrel | Energy vs Pistol | Suggested Damage |
|-------------|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Pocket pistol | 3" | -12% | 30 |
| Standard pistol | 4" | Baseline | **34** |
| Full-size pistol | 5" | +6% | 36 |
| Short SMG (MP5K/TEC-9) | 4.5-5" | +9% | 37 |
| Standard SMG (MP5/Scorpion) | 7-9" | +25-29% | **42-44** |
| PCC/Carbine (SUB-2000/AR-9) | 16" | +35-40% | **46-47** |

The **4.5" SMG barrel produces nearly identical damage to a 5" full-size pistol**—the real SMG advantage lies in accuracy and controllability from the stock/brace configuration. A shooter with an SMG achieves **2" groups at 25 yards** versus 3-4" with a pistol, and can engage targets reliably at **100+ yards** versus 25-50 yards for handguns.

**Balancing SMGs against rifles**: 9mm carbines produce approximately **30-37% of 5.56 rifle energy** at the muzzle and even less at range. SMG damage should never approach rifle values. The energy plateau beyond 10-12" barrel length (only 8% gain from 8" to 16") suggests carbine-length 9mm weapons shouldn't dramatically out-damage standard SMGs.

Rate of fire differentiation matters significantly: the Scorpion's **1,150 RPM** versus the MP5's **900 RPM** versus the MPX's **850 RPM** creates distinct handling characteristics despite similar calibers. Higher cyclic rates increase difficulty of controlled automatic fire but enable faster time-to-incapacitation in close quarters.

---

## Part 10: Platform comparison reveals distinct tactical niches

| Platform | Barrel | Weight | Fire Rate | Accuracy | Recoil | Effective Range | Damage | Quality |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|--------|-----------------|--------|---------|
| **H&K MP5K** | 4.53" | 4.4 lbs | 900 RPM | Excellent | **Low** | 50m | 37 | Premium |
| **SIG MPX K** | 4.5" | 5.0 lbs | 850 RPM | Excellent | **Very Low** | 75m | 37 | Premium |
| **CZ Scorpion EVO 3** | 7.72" | 5.0 lbs | **1,150 RPM** | Good | Moderate | 100m | 42 | Mid |
| **Intratec TEC-9** | 5" | 3.1 lbs | Semi-only | **Poor** | High | 25m | 36 | Budget |
| **MPA30** | 4.5-5.5" | 3.4 lbs | Semi-only | Moderate | Moderate | 50m | 37 | Mid |
| **AR-9 (RAM 9)** | 8" | 5.2 lbs | Semi-only | **Excellent** | Moderate | 100m | 43 | Varies |
| **Kel-Tec SUB-2000** | 16.25" | **4.25 lbs** | Semi-only | Good | Moderate | 150m | **47** | Budget |

**Operating system hierarchy for recoil**: Gas piston (MPX) < Roller-delayed (MP5) < Radial delayed (CMMG AR-9) < Simple blowback (Scorpion/TEC-9/SUB-2000). The SIG MPX's gas piston system produces the softest shooting experience, followed closely by the MP5's legendary roller-delayed action.

**Unique game mechanics by platform**:

- **MP5K**: Smoothest recoil, fastest controllable full-auto, premium tactical choice
- **MPX**: Best suppressed performance, AR-familiar controls, fires while folded
- **Scorpion**: Highest fire rate, budget pricing, extensive aftermarket
- **TEC-9**: Worst accuracy (spray pattern), unreliable (occasional malfunction mechanic), criminal association
- **MPA30**: Improved TEC-9 concept, accessory-ready, multi-caliber potential
- **AR-9**: Most accurate, familiar AR controls, highly customizable
- **SUB-2000**: Folds to backpack size, lightest weight, highest velocity, pistol magazine sharing

The velocity advantage of the 16" SUB-2000 (**~1,300 fps**) over the 4.5" MP5K (**~1,150 fps**) translates to approximately **28% more energy**—meaningful but not transformative. The practical differences in accuracy, controllability, and tactical employment matter more than the modest damage scaling these velocity differences support.
