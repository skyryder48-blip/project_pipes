# Batch 12: 5.56/.223 rifle platforms for FiveM weapon meta

Six modern rifle platforms chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO share the same ammunition but deliver dramatically different handling characteristics for game implementation. The **20" barreled M16A4 and Steyr AUG** achieve optimal **3,100-3,250 fps** muzzle velocities with M193, while the **16" PSA AR-15** loses approximately **200 fps**. Bullpup designs like the AUG and Tavor pack rifle-length barrels into packages **8+ inches shorter** than conventional rifles. The **CZ BREN 2** offers the most modular platform with barrel options from 8" to 16", while the **IWI Tavor** provides proven combat reliability through its long-stroke piston system.

## Colt M16A4: the benchmark military rifle

The M16A4 represents the pinnacle of the M16 family, featuring a **20-inch cold hammer-forged barrel** with rifle-length direct impingement gas system. At **39.63 inches overall** and **7.5 lbs empty** (8.79 lbs loaded), it establishes the baseline for 5.56 NATO performance.

| Specification | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| Barrel length | 20" (508mm) |
| Overall length | 39.63" |
| Weight empty/loaded | 7.5 lbs / 8.79 lbs |
| Rate of fire | 700-950 RPM cyclic |
| Effective range | 550m point / 800m area |
| Sight radius | 19.75" |
| Accuracy | 4-4.5 MOA (mil-spec) |
| Recoil energy | 3.9 ft-lbs |

**Muzzle velocity from 20" barrel** reaches optimal 5.56 performance: **M193 at 3,200-3,280 fps**, **M855 at 3,100-3,150 fps**, and **Mk262 at 2,750-2,850 fps**. The rifle-length gas system positions the gas port 13 inches from the chamber, delivering smoother operation and significantly improved reliability compared to carbine-length systems—a 2002 USMC assessment found M4 carbines failed **3× more often** than M16A4s over 69,000 rounds.

The M16A4 was adopted in **July 1997** and served as USMC standard issue from 2003 until the transition to M4 carbines completed in September 2016. It remains in service with Greece, Iraq, Malaysia, Turkey, Tunisia, and the UK.

## PSA AR-15: civilian baseline at budget pricing

Palmetto State Armory's AR-15 represents the entry-level market leader, delivering mil-spec internals at **$499-549** for the PA-15 Classic. The **16-inch nitride barrel** with carbine-length gas system produces measurable velocity reductions compared to the M16A4's 20" configuration.

| Ammunition | 20" barrel | 16" barrel | Velocity loss |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| M193 (55gr) | 3,200-3,280 fps | 2,968-3,100 fps | ~150-250 fps |
| M855 (62gr) | 3,100-3,150 fps | 2,920-3,000 fps | ~150-200 fps |
| Mk262 (77gr) | 2,750-2,850 fps | 2,685-2,769 fps | ~80-100 fps |

At **6.5-6.8 lbs empty** and **32-33 inches overall**, the PSA handles faster than the full-length M16A4. Accuracy expectations run **3-3.5 MOA** with standard barrels, improving to **1.5-2 MOA** with premium CHF barrel models and match ammunition. The mil-spec trigger pulls **6.5-8.5 lbs**, though the Enhanced Polished Trigger (EPT) reduces this to **5-6 lbs**.

Reliability testing shows **99% non-repair/return ratios** after a 200-round break-in period. Garand Thumb's torture test ran 5,000 rounds full-auto suppressed with only an extractor replacement at 4,000 rounds. Construction uses forged 7075-T6 aluminum receivers and shot-peened Carpenter No. 158 steel bolts meeting mil-spec standards.

## Generic AR-15 velocity curves across barrel lengths

The 5.56 NATO cartridge was optimized for **20-inch barrels**—M855/SS109 achieves peak velocity at this length with diminishing returns beyond 24 inches where barrel friction exceeds propellant benefits.

| Barrel length | M193 (55gr) | M855 (62gr) | Mk262 (77gr) |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 10.3" (Mk18) | 2,660-2,700 fps | 2,520-2,570 fps | 2,350-2,450 fps |
| 11.5" | 2,700-2,750 fps | 2,580-2,630 fps | 2,420-2,500 fps |
| 14.5" (M4) | 2,850-2,920 fps | 2,750-2,820 fps | 2,600-2,670 fps |
| 16" | 2,950-3,000 fps | 2,870-2,920 fps | 2,680-2,750 fps |
| 18" (SPR) | 3,080-3,130 fps | 2,980-3,040 fps | 2,750-2,850 fps |
| 20" (M16) | 3,180-3,250 fps | 3,050-3,100 fps | 2,800-2,870 fps |

Velocity loss per inch **increases dramatically** as barrels shorten: approximately **25-50 fps/inch** from 20" to 16", accelerating to **80-120 fps/inch** below 12 inches due to higher residual chamber pressures at bullet exit.

**Terminal ballistics threshold**: M855 requires impact velocity above **2,500 fps** for reliable fragmentation. A 10.3" barrel starts below this threshold at the muzzle, making the Mk18/CQBR configuration marginal for terminal effectiveness beyond close quarters. The 20" M16 maintains fragmentation capability to approximately **300 yards**, while the 14.5" M4 drops below threshold at roughly **150 yards**.

## Steyr AUG A3: Austrian bullpup with integrated optics

The AUG A3 demonstrates bullpup efficiency—its **20-inch barrel** delivers full rifle ballistics in a package measuring just **31.1 inches overall**, making it **8.4 inches shorter** than the M16A4 with identical barrel length.

| Specification | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| Overall length (20" bbl) | 31.1" (790mm) |
| Weight empty/loaded | 7.9 lbs / 9.0 lbs |
| Rate of fire | 680-750 RPM |
| Operating system | Short-stroke gas piston |
| Effective range | 300m point / 400m area |
| Accuracy | 1.5-2 MOA with match ammo |
| Stock trigger | 9-10 lbs (improves to 5-6 lbs with upgrades) |

The **short-stroke gas piston** vents combustion gases forward rather than into the receiver, running significantly cleaner than direct impingement systems. A **3-position gas regulator** provides normal operation, adverse conditions/suppressed mode, and a closed position for grenade launching.

Bullpup trigger linkage creates inherent mechanical disadvantage—the **extended trigger bar** connecting the forward trigger to rear fire control produces a **9-10 lb stock pull** with perceptible creep. Aftermarket options like the Trigger Tamer reduce pull to 5-6 lbs. The integrated **1.5× or 3× Swarovski optic** provides exceptional glass quality with backup iron sights cast into the housing.

Recoil characteristics favor the bullpup: center of gravity positioned near the shooter's shoulder reduces muzzle rise and delivers a "gentle push" rather than sharp impulse. Austria adopted the AUG as the **StG 77** in 1977, with **30+ countries** now fielding variants including Australia's F88 Austeyr and Ireland's IW Steyr.

## CZ BREN 2: modular Czech military standard

The BREN 2 offers unmatched modularity with barrel options from **8" to 16.5"** and caliber conversion between 5.56×45mm, 7.62×39mm, and .300 Blackout. Its **short-stroke gas piston** delivers recoil described as "almost comically light"—softer than comparable AR-15s.

| Barrel | Overall (extended/folded) | Weight | Muzzle velocity |
|--------|---------------------------|--------|-----------------|
| 8" | 27-28" / 19.9" | 5.4 lbs | 2,300-2,450 fps |
| 11" | 31-32" / 22.8" | 5.7 lbs | 2,550-2,650 fps |
| 14" | 35.6" / 25.8" | 5.86 lbs | 2,800-2,900 fps |
| 16.5" | 35.7-38.5" / 28.3" | 6.37 lbs | 2,950-3,000 fps |

The **850 RPM cyclic rate** (±100 RPM) exceeds most 5.56 platforms. A **3-position gas regulator** provides normal, adverse/suppressed, and closed settings. The rotating bolt uses 6 locking lugs with **0.805" diameter**—larger than AR-15's 0.740"—increasing bolt face strength.

Accuracy runs **1.5-2.5 MOA** with quality ammunition, and the **two-stage trigger** pulls 3.0-4.5 lbs with crisp break and short reset. Barrel service life reaches **20,000 rounds minimum** with system life at 30,000 rounds.

The Czech Army ordered 2,600 BREN 2s in January 2016 as the CZ 805 replacement, with a framework agreement for up to **16,000+ rifles totaling $111 million**. France's elite GIGN counter-terrorism unit adopted the 7.62×39mm variant specifically for enhanced barrier penetration.

## IWI Tavor/CTAR-21: battle-proven Israeli bullpup

The Tavor family includes the **TAR-21** (18.1" barrel), **CTAR-21** compact (15" barrel), civilian **SAR/X95** (16.5"/18"), and **Micro-Tavor** (13" barrel). All variants use the same **long-stroke gas piston** system—similar to the AK-47 and Galil—providing extreme reliability in desert conditions.

| Variant | Barrel | Overall length | Weight |
|---------|--------|----------------|--------|
| TAR-21 | 18.1" | 28.5" | 7.9 lbs |
| CTAR-21 | 15" | 25.2" | 7.7 lbs |
| Tavor SAR | 16.5" | 26.125" | 7.9 lbs |
| X95 | 16.5" | 26" | 7.0 lbs |

The long-stroke system differs fundamentally from the AUG's short-stroke design: the piston travels the full length of the bolt carrier stroke rather than imparting momentum through a short impact. This creates **slightly more reciprocating mass** but delivers exceptional extraction force and reliability.

The **notorious stock trigger** pulls **11-12 lbs** on early SAR models—the X95 improved this to **5.5-6.5 lbs**. Aftermarket triggers from Geissele ($355) and Timney ($350-365) reduce pull to 4-7.5 lbs with two-stage characteristics.

Accuracy expectations run **2-3 MOA** with ball ammunition, improving to **1.5-2 MOA** with match loads. The **750-900 RPM** cyclic rate suits controlled automatic fire. Height-over-bore measures approximately **4 inches** compared to AR-15's 2.5 inches—significant for close-range holdover.

IDF adoption began with field testing in 2001, full operational service in 2006, and X95 selection as future standard infantry weapon in 2009. The Tavor "functioned flawlessly" during Operation Cast Lead (2008-2009) per IDF reports. Over **20 countries** field Tavor variants including India, Ukraine (Fort-221), Georgia, Colombia, and Vietnam.

## 5.56 NATO versus .223 Remington: chamber and pressure realities

The apparent **13% pressure difference** between cartridges—.223 at 55,000 psi (SAAMI) versus 5.56 at 62,366 psi (NATO)—results primarily from incompatible measurement methods, not actual pressure variance. When measured identically, both cartridges produce approximately **55,000 psi maximum working pressure**.

| Feature | .223 Remington | 5.56 NATO | .223 Wylde |
|---------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Leade/throat | Short (~0.025") | Long (~0.125") | 5.56 length |
| Freebore diameter | 0.2240" | Larger | 0.2240" |
| Throat angle | Steeper | 1.5° gentler | 1.5° (5.56) |

The critical difference lies in **chamber throat dimensions**. The 5.56 NATO chamber's longer leade allows bullets to travel further before engaging rifling, reducing pressure spikes. Firing 5.56 NATO ammunition in a .223 Remington chamber forces the bullet into rifling sooner, potentially causing dangerous pressure increases—**not recommended**.

**.223 Wylde chambers** combine 5.56 NATO's longer throat angle with .223 Remington's tighter freebore diameter, safely handling both cartridges while maintaining match-grade accuracy. This explains why most modern AR-15s are chambered in 5.56 NATO or .223 Wylde rather than pure .223 Remington.

## Ammunition types: three categories for game implementation

### Civilian expanding rounds (damage +30%, armor penetration -80%)

Designed for maximum energy transfer through controlled expansion, hunting/varmint ammunition like **Hornady V-MAX**, **Federal Fusion**, and **Nosler Ballistic Tip** delivers devastating soft-tissue performance but poor barrier penetration.

| Load | Weight | Muzzle velocity | Muzzle energy | Expansion |
|------|--------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| V-MAX Standard | 55gr | 3,240 fps | 1,282 ft-lbs | 2×+ diameter |
| V-MAX Superformance | 53gr | 3,465 fps | 1,413 ft-lbs | Explosive |
| Federal Fusion | 62gr | 3,000 fps | 1,239 ft-lbs | ~0.50" |

V-MAX bullets expand effectively down to **1,600 fps** impact velocity through polymer-tip-driven fragmentation. Penetration depth runs **6-10 inches** in soft tissue—adequate for varmints and predators but limited by violent fragmentation. Federal Fusion's bonded core retains **85-95% weight** with 16-20+ inch penetration, making it effective on deer-sized game to 200 yards.

**Game implementation**: Highest damage against unarmored targets, drastically reduced effectiveness against armor and barriers.

### Military standard rounds (baseline damage)

**M193 (55gr FMJ)** at 3,250 fps and **M855 (62gr steel penetrator)** at 3,000-3,020 fps represent the baseline military loads.

| Load | Muzzle velocity | Fragmentation threshold | Fragmentation range (20" bbl) |
|------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| M193 | 3,250 fps | 2,500-2,700 fps | ~200 yards |
| M855 | 3,000-3,020 fps | ~2,500 fps | ~150-175 yards |
| M855A1 | 3,150 fps (M16) | Lower threshold | ~250+ yards |

M193 delivers **superior terminal performance** against unarmored targets within fragmentation range through violent yaw and fragmentation at the cannelure. M855's steel penetrator provides better barrier penetration but inconsistent soft-tissue effects—"ice-picking" reports from Iraq/Afghanistan describe clean through-and-through wounds with minimal tissue damage.

**M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round** represents significant improvement: exposed 19gr hardened steel penetrator with copper core maintains consistent terminal effects at all practical distances. It **outperformed 7.62mm M80 ball** against soft targets in Army testing while penetrating 3/8" mild steel at 350m from an M4 carbine (versus M855's 160m capability).

### Armor piercing (M995 black tip: damage -25%, penetration +150%)

The **52-grain M995** uses a **32.2-grain tungsten carbide penetrator** core to defeat Level III body armor and penetrate 12mm rolled homogeneous armor at 100 meters.

| Target | M995 penetration |
|--------|------------------|
| 12mm RHA | Yes @ 100m |
| 7mm RHA | Yes @ 200m |
| Level III armor | Yes (defeats most) |
| Level IV armor | Variable by plate construction |

Soft-tissue performance is **significantly reduced**—the hard tungsten core does not expand or fragment, creating ice-pick wounds similar to low-velocity FMJ. M995 is designed for hard target penetration, not anti-personnel lethality.

**Availability**: Extremely rare on civilian market at **$20-70+ per round** when found. Falls under federal AP ammunition definition (tungsten carbide core) without M855's explicit ATF exemption.

## Game damage modifiers by ammunition type

| Ammunition | vs Unarmored | vs Light armor | vs Heavy armor | Barrier pen |
|------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| M193 | 1.15× | 0.7× | 0.4× | Medium |
| **M855 (baseline)** | **1.0×** | **1.0×** | **0.6×** | **Medium-high** |
| M855A1 | 1.10× | 1.25× | 0.8× | High |
| M995 AP | 0.75× | 1.5× | 1.2× | Very high |
| V-MAX/Expanding | 1.30× | 0.5× | 0.2× | Low |
| Hunting (Fusion) | 1.25× | 0.6× | 0.3× | Low |

## Conclusion

These six platforms represent the spectrum of modern 5.56 NATO rifle development. The **M16A4** establishes the performance ceiling with its optimized 20" barrel, while **bullpup designs** from Steyr and IWI deliver equivalent ballistics in packages 20-25% shorter. The **CZ BREN 2** provides maximum modularity for varied mission requirements, and the **PSA AR-15** offers accessible civilian entry at budget pricing.

For FiveM implementation, barrel length should directly influence both damage output and effective range, with **20" configurations dealing full damage** and **10.3" SBRs reduced to approximately 80%**. Ammunition selection creates meaningful tactical choices: expanding rounds maximize soft-target damage but fail against armor, while M995 AP defeats protection but underperforms against unarmored opponents. The gas system type (DI vs short-stroke vs long-stroke) should primarily affect reliability statistics and recoil characteristics rather than raw damage output.
