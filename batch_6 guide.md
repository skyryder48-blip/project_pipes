# Comprehensive Magnum Revolver Ballistics for FiveM Weapon Meta

The .44 Magnum, .41 Magnum, and .500 S&W Magnum represent three distinct tiers of handgun power, with muzzle energies ranging from **760–1,200 ft-lbs** for .41/.44 Magnum to an extraordinary **2,500–3,032 ft-lbs** for the .500 S&W. Using the reference standard of 9mm Luger at 34 base damage and .357 Magnum at 60, these magnum calibers scale to approximately **68–78** (.41 Mag), **82–123** (.44 Mag), and **155–215** (.500 S&W) depending on barrel length. All four revolvers share N-frame or larger construction with 5–6 round capacities, but recoil characteristics vary dramatically—from the manageable **14–16 ft-lbs** of .41 Magnum to the punishing **40–64 ft-lbs** of full-power .500 S&W loads.

## Caliber 1: .44 Remington Magnum ballistics

### FMJ and hard cast performance by barrel length

The .44 Magnum's performance scales significantly with barrel length. Testing from Ballistics By The Inch demonstrates velocity gains of approximately **50–75 fps per inch** of barrel.

| Bullet Weight | 4" Barrel (fps/ft-lbs) | 6" Barrel (fps/ft-lbs) | 8.375" Barrel (fps/ft-lbs) |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 180gr JHP | 1,150 / 528 | 1,321 / 697 | 1,433 / 821 |
| 200gr Gold Dot | 1,099 / 535 | 1,197 / 636 | 1,282 / 730 |
| 240gr Hydra-Shok | 1,251 / 833 | 1,380 / 1,014 | 1,497 / 1,194 |
| 300gr Hard Cast | 1,050 / 734 | 1,150 / 881 | 1,250 / 1,041 |

**Energy comparison to .357 Magnum**: The .44 Magnum delivers **65–80% more muzzle energy** than .357 Magnum with equivalent barrel lengths. A 6" .44 Magnum produces approximately **1,000 ft-lbs** versus **540–580 ft-lbs** for .357 Magnum.

### JHP self-defense and hunting specifications

| Load | Velocity (6" bbl) | Penetration | Expansion | Weight Retention |
|------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Hornady 240gr XTP | 1,350 fps | 25" | 0.628" | 95% (228gr) |
| Federal Hydra-Shok 240gr | 1,380 fps | 18–24" | 0.55–0.60" | 90%+ |
| Speer Gold Dot 200gr SB | 1,197 fps | 14–18" | 0.58–0.65" | 85%+ |

The .44 Magnum is considered **overkill for self-defense** because it consistently penetrates **20–30 inches** in ballistic gel—far exceeding the FBI's recommended 12–18" window. Heavy hunting bullets maintain velocity for bone-crushing terminal performance, but this same characteristic creates dangerous over-penetration in urban defensive scenarios.

### Recoil characteristics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Recoil Energy | **18.5 ft-lbs** (typical 240gr load) |
| Comparison to .357 Mag | 60% more recoil |
| N-frame benefit | Reduces felt recoil by 20–25% vs lighter frames |
| Practical fire rate | 2–3 aimed shots per second maximum |

## Caliber 2: .41 Remington Magnum ballistics

### The "Police .44" that never was

Designed in 1963 by Elmer Keith, Bill Jordan, and Skeeter Skelton, the .41 Magnum was intended as a law enforcement cartridge bridging .357 and .44 Magnum. The concept failed when Remington **"warmed up" the police load** to 1,150 fps (too hot for agency comfort) and named it "Magnum"—a term police administrators associated with excessive force liability.

### FMJ and hard cast specifications

| Bullet Weight | 4" Barrel (fps/ft-lbs) | 6" Barrel (fps/ft-lbs) | 8" Barrel (fps/ft-lbs) |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 170gr JHP | 1,481 / 829 | 1,678 / 1,063 | 1,871 / 1,320 |
| 210gr Gold Dot | 1,268 / 749 | 1,445 / 974 | 1,567 / 1,145 |
| 230gr Keith HC | 1,310 / 877 | 1,450 / 1,074 | 1,520 / 1,180 |
| 265gr LWN | 1,230 / 893 | 1,350 / 1,072 | 1,420 / 1,180 |

**Energy positioning**: The .41 Magnum delivers **25–41% more energy** than .357 Magnum while producing **15–20% less energy** than .44 Magnum—exactly the middle-ground performance its designers intended.

### JHP hunting and defense loads

**Premium factory offerings**:
- **Hornady 210gr XTP**: 1,545 fps / 1,113 ft-lbs (6" barrel)
- **Buffalo Bore 170gr JHP**: 1,650 fps / 1,028 ft-lbs
- **Buffalo Bore 230gr Keith HC**: 1,450 fps / 1,074 ft-lbs
- **Underwood 210gr XTP**: 1,560 fps / 1,135 ft-lbs

The .41 Magnum remains **underrated** because the 1971 "Dirty Harry" film cemented the .44 Magnum's cultural dominance. Marshall & Sanow called it "one of our most unappreciated calibers."

### Recoil advantage

| Caliber | Recoil Energy | Controllability |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| .357 Magnum | 11.5 ft-lbs | Excellent |
| **.41 Magnum** | **14–16 ft-lbs** | **Good in N-frame** |
| .44 Magnum | 18.5 ft-lbs | Moderate |

The .41 Magnum produces **20–30% less felt recoil** than .44 Magnum in equivalent firearms and can be managed one-handed by experienced shooters.

## Caliber 3: .500 S&W Magnum ballistics

### The most powerful production handgun cartridge

Introduced in February 2003 by Cor-Bon and Smith & Wesson, the .500 S&W Magnum operates at a maximum **60,000 PSI** and launches half-inch diameter projectiles weighing 275–700 grains at velocities exceeding 1,600 fps.

### Velocity and energy by barrel length

| Bullet Weight | 4" (fps/ft-lbs) | 6.5" (fps/ft-lbs) | 8.375" (fps/ft-lbs) | 10.5" (fps/ft-lbs) |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 275gr Barnes | 1,600 / 1,682 | 1,750 / 2,100 | 1,990 / 2,419 | 2,100 / 2,600 |
| 300gr FTX | 1,850 / 2,280 | 1,975 / 2,600 | 2,075 / 2,868 | 2,150 / 3,080 |
| 350gr XTP | 1,650 / 2,200 | 1,850 / 2,600 | 1,975 / **3,032** | 2,000 / 3,200 |
| 400gr JFN | 1,450 / 1,870 | 1,575 / 2,150 | 1,750 / 2,491 | 1,850 / 2,700 |
| 440gr LFN | 1,400 / 1,920 | 1,525 / 2,200 | 1,700 / 2,884 | 1,800 / 2,900 |
| 500gr XTP | 1,250 / 1,740 | 1,375 / 2,000 | 1,550 / 2,499 | 1,600 / 2,600 |
| 700gr HC | 1,000 / 1,560 | 1,100 / 1,880 | 1,200 / **2,366** | 1,250 / 2,500 |

### Comparison to rifle cartridges

The .500 S&W Magnum from an 8" barrel **equals or exceeds** common rifle cartridge performance:

| Cartridge | Typical Muzzle Energy | .500 S&W Comparison |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| .30-30 Winchester | 1,900 ft-lbs | .500 exceeds by 50–60% |
| .308 Winchester | 2,650 ft-lbs | Comparable performance |
| .30-06 Springfield | 2,900 ft-lbs | Full-power .500 is equivalent |
| 12 Gauge Slug | 2,500 ft-lbs | Direct match |

### Extreme penetration capabilities

| Load Type | Gel Penetration | Game Application |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| 350gr XTP JHP | 19.5" | Medium/large game |
| 440gr Hard Cast | 31–32" | Bear defense |
| 500gr Hard Cast | 32"+ | Cape buffalo |
| 700gr Hard Cast | **5–6 feet** through muscle/bone | Dangerous game |

### Extreme recoil characteristics

| Configuration | Recoil Energy | Comparison |
|--------------|---------------|------------|
| 350gr @ 1,400 fps (reduced) | 25 ft-lbs | Manageable |
| 400gr @ 1,675 fps | **39.9 ft-lbs** | 3× .44 Magnum |
| 350gr @ 1,975 fps | ~45 ft-lbs | Exceeds 12ga slug |
| 700gr @ 1,200 fps | **64 ft-lbs** | Severe |

Practical fire rate is limited to **3–5 aimed rounds per minute**. The compensator reduces felt recoil by approximately **20–30%** and muzzle flip by "several inches." Improper grip risks wrist injury or involuntary double-discharge.

## Conclusion: Scaling hierarchy for game implementation

The three magnum calibers establish a clear power progression. The .41 Magnum slots neatly between .357 Magnum (60 damage) and .44 Magnum with approximately **68–78 base damage**—reflecting its real-world positioning as the "forgotten middle child." The .44 Magnum's **82–115 damage range** represents nearly double 9mm effectiveness while remaining within conventional handgun territory.

The .500 S&W Magnum represents a categorical jump requiring special handling. Its **160–215 damage values** approach rifle territory, justified by real-world energy parity with .308 Winchester. However, this power comes at severe cost: fire rates 50% slower than other magnums, recoil amplitudes 2–2.5× higher, and weapon weights exceeding 4.5 pounds.

For balanced gameplay, the heavy-frame revolvers (Taurus Raging Bull at 53–63 oz, Model 500 at 57–82 oz) should receive slight recoil bonuses over the lighter Model 29 (42–50 oz), reflecting their real-world design purpose of taming extreme cartridge power through mass.
